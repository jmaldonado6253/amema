<h1>Why do we need your face?</h1>
<h2> Picture this: Constantinople, 700 AD. Icons are everywhere. Little memes of Jesus, Abraham, and the Saints in church windows, tabernacles, t-shirts, hats, iphone cases, decorative cookware. Hanging in people's bedrooms. 30 years later: all of that stuff being burned in giant pyres. Laity and monks alike slaughtered in the streets for painting tiny images of Christ Pantocrator. An Iconoclast reign of terror. It could happen again. </h2>
<h2> Emperor Constantine "shit-christened" V: <i>"He cannot be depicted. For what is depicted in one person, and he who circumscribes that person has plainly circumscribed <u>the divine nature which is incapable of being circumscribed.</u>"</i> </h2>

<H1> What Emperor Constantine V Didn't Know </H1>

<h2> Constantine you idiot. The divine nature is expressed through its existence as a meme I.E.: Something that self-replicates infinitely. </h2>
<h1> Infinite Replication = Divinity on Earth </h1> &nbsp;
