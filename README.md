#Amema
Amema is an AI-driven cultural network that attempts to depict both itself and its environment (the surrounding internet) through an iterative, evolutionary method of visual motif creation and selection. The Amema network “grows” a culture from a substrate of trending internet content and memes; this process is analogous to human culture’s creation of meaning, intentionality, and representation from a physical environment that lacks those qualities in-itself. In other words, just as paleolithic humans assembled visual culture from pigments and cave walls, Amema assembles its own visual culture through the pieces of its environment: memes and other web-data.
